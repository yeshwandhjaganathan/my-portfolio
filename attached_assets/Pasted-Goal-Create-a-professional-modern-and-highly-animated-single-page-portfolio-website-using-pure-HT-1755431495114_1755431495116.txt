Goal: Create a professional, modern, and highly animated single-page portfolio website using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 (no external animation libraries). It must be mobile-first, responsive, fast, accessible (WCAG AA), and SEO-ready.

Brand & Style

Clean, minimalist dark theme with subtle glassmorphism cards and soft shadows.

Rounded corners (lg+), generous whitespace, fluid spacing.

Smooth micro-interactions: link hovers, button press states, card tilts (CSS only).

Typography: clear hierarchy (hero 48–64px on desktop, scale down gracefully).

Add a tasteful accent color for highlights (derive from hero image or a gradient).

Use Bootstrap utilities where possible; custom CSS only for animations/details.


Global Layout

Sticky navbar with brand logo (initials “YJS”), smooth scroll to sections, active link highlighting on scroll.

Sections (in order): Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications, Activities, Contact, Footer.

Include a “Back to top” floating button that fades in/out on scroll.

Provide light/dark toggle (store preference in localStorage).


Animations (vanilla CSS + JS)

Page load fade-in and hero content typewriter headline.

Scroll-reveal (IntersectionObserver): sections slide/fade from different directions.

Counters for years/metrics (e.g., CGPA, project count).

Parallax hero background (CSS transform on scroll, JS throttled).

Skill bars/chips animate on entering viewport.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable animations for those users.
